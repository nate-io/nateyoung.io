# Migrating from Gatsby to Astro

After using Gatsby for my personal website for several years, I decided it was time for a refresh. Gatsby has served me well, but I wanted to try something newer and more aligned with modern web development practices.

## Why Astro?

Astro offers several advantages that made it an attractive option:

- **Islands Architecture**: Only the interactive parts of my site ship JavaScript
- **Excellent DX**: The development experience is fantastic
- **Simple Content Management**: Built-in content collections for blog posts
- **Fast Performance**: Static site generation with minimal JS
- **Framework Agnostic**: I can use React, Vue, Svelte, or plain HTML as needed

## Migration Process

The migration process was relatively straightforward:

1. Set up a new Astro project
2. Migrate components from React to Astro format
3. Move data files and assets
4. Configure styling with Tailwind CSS
5. Add blog functionality with Astro content collections
6. Deploy to GCP

## Visual Refresh

Along with the technical migration, I also took the opportunity to update the visual design with a Netflix-inspired color palette:

- Dark backgrounds for better readability
- Strong red accents for emphasis
- Clear typography for improved user experience

## Lessons Learned

The biggest takeaway from this migration is that modern web frameworks like Astro make it easier than ever to build fast, content-focused websites. The developer experience is excellent, and the performance benefits are significant.
